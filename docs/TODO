Fix search bar behavior (part of it is fixed I think!)
    -  When you click on a link in the navbar it freaks out.

    - I don't think the search index is properly decoupled (store-wise) from the
      search index? Like. You should be able to have a static search results while
      looking for a new query and I Think the problem is that u r replacing *everything* as the users.

When you comment on a song on a show page every other song disappears.

fix seed data so english words aren't common between artists.
