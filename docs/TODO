to do:
Fix search bar behavior (part of it is fixed I think!)
    -  when I do an onBlur I don't necessarily want the query string to disappear, just the
       visibility of the suggestions

    - I don't think the search index is properly decoupled (store-wise) from the
      search index? Like. You should be able to have a static search results while
      looking for a new query and I Think the problem is that u r replacing *everything* as the users.

Your follow suggestions are really janky....!!!!
fix seed data so english words
